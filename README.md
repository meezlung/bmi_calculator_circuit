# bmi_calculator_circuit

A CS 20 Project last semester designed to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) given:
- $6$-bit $w$ - weight (in kilograms)
- $6$-bit $h$ - height (in meters)

Note: It only supports the following ranges:
- Weight: 34 kg to 97 kg, inclusive
- Height: 152 cm to 215 cm, inclusive

This project was implemented using Logisim by:
- Mansur Batistil
- Ethan Mislang
- Juan Marco Peralta
- And yours truly!

# How to Run the Circuit
1. Download and open the `.circ` file in Logisim.
2. Provide inputs for $w$ and $h$ using the input pins.
3. Observe the BMI output from the designated output display.
